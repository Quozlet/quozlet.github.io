# Quozlet.net

Repository for the static ([HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5) and CSS3 only) website at [quozlet.net](https://quozlet.net). Licensed under the [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) generates most of the CSS used.

## Testing

Currently tested manually for the latest [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)), Safari, and Firefox browsers. This may change in the future.

## Building
You must have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. `yarn build` will generate the CSS needed, and opening [index.html](./index.html) is all that's needed.
